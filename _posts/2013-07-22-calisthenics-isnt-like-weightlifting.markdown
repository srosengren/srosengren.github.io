So today is my first day of summer vacation and I thought that would be a good date to write a post about my progress with my [calisthenics goal](/blog/first-day-of-calisthenics).

First thought, Calisthenics isn't like lifting weights. Lifting weights has been pretty much the single form of excercise (besides some regular cardio) for me for the past few years and I still love it, I just hate that I'm not as "fit" as I used to be when doing martial arts (which my knee prevents me from doing).

Anyways, I'm now up to doing 8 one hand pushups (if it's the first excercise for teh session), I haven't been doing knuckle pushups that much so I'm at about 34 reps now but they are a lot easier than when I started. I did 20 pseudo planches this morning which I think is pretty good and I believe that I'm using good form since it feels like my feet are about to lift. I also did 8 pseudo planches where I push with my feet and try to get some hang time. I think I will incorporate these more since it felt like it really tested my strength and stability. I'm also up to a 25 sec tuck planche on a dip bar, it's alot less on the ground with flat palms but part of that is due to my wrists and lack of balance, I will have to step my game up with the frog and advanced frog to help me with this.

I could probably have worked more on this during the last month but I'm pretty happy with what I accomplished.
