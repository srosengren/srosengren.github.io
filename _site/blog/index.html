<p>Asp.net vnext now supports creating authorization policies through code. What this means is that you no longer have to copy paste your role/claim names all over your application (Or build your own system around this). You can instead declare policies in a central place and authorize based on these, allowing for easier/safer refactoring.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>I’m currently converting a webapplication into a multi-tenant solution for a client at work. Handling translations in the app is currently done using resource (.resx) files to build a master resource collection. The client can then translate any resource into a specific language using a separate tool that creates satellite assemblies which are then dropped into the bin folder, just like visual studio does if you create a specific culture .resx file. The application then sets the culture based on the Accept-Language header when it receives a request (unless it’s already been set). The user can override this inside the application.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>I love javascript, I really do. One of the things i really enjoy about the language is its dynamic nature where objects are actually hashmaps, associate arrays, dictionaries, or whatever you want to call it. This gives us the ability to get and assign properties using indexing and property names instead of the dot syntax used in most languages (but we can use that to), we can also enumerate over an objects properties which is key to what this post is about.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>The augmentation factory pattern is an extension of the normal factory pattern when working with dynamic languages. It can be thought of as a way to get interfaces into javascript, or a way to deal with inheritance without using any actual inheritance. I do not find it helpful when working with class based languages but I do use it extensively when writing javascript.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>I create a lot of different APIs in my work, several of them send out fairly large arrays of objects where the property names of these objects are the bulk of the data being transfered. This is mostly mitigated by compressing the data, but I figured, why not try and see if I can shrink it down a bit more. Most of the APIs are consumed on mobile devices and every second counts. This means that any byte we can save over the line has to be weighed against the cost of reconstructing the objects on the client.</p>

Elements without any whitespace between them will be treated as a single continuous element (but keeping their individual applied styling), until hitting  the edge of the parent.</p>

For instance it’s responsible for serializing your c# object to json when you do <code>return Request.CreateResponse(object);</code> in webapi and the request has the contentType header set to <code>application/json</code>.</p>

<p>I should probably begin by saying that I have no idea if there is any prior art for this, this is something that I just came up with while building the back-end for a new application. It is meant to simplify making a sequence of repository calls from your busines logic while still having it transactional. It is yet to be fully battle tested but initial tests looks like it’s working.</p>

This is yet another way in which LESS shines in comparission to writing plain old CSS. What we can do here is modify the pattern of having a “main” or “master” less file that includes other LESS “modules”, the easiest thing to do here is to have several “main/master” files, one for each brand. These in turn will look the same but include different brand specific LESS files, among other LESS files that they share between them. For instance a brand(a)(b)(c)colors.less that each define the <code>@color-primary</code> variable, with different colors.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>This should have been fairly obvious, but we cannot expect the ViewBag to persist since a RedirectToAction only serves the client with a 302 redirected HTTP response to the new route. A solution for this is to use “TempData[“key”]”, this is a dictionary that is persisted in the users session meaning that we can retrieve it in the new action or controller or wherever the recieving end is.</p>

        <div class="post__excerpt"><p>I was experimenting with a new contentpart widget tonight, and when I was done I had a couple of UpdateFromX methods in my migrations.cs file. So I thought to myself, this doesn’t look very good, lets delete everything from the DB and then combine this to a pretty Create method instead. At first I thought, hey maybe I’ll only have to remove the table that stores the records themselved. This was of course not enought. I realized that I also had to remove it from the Orchard_Framework_DataMigrationRecord and Orchard_Framework_ContentTypeRecord tables. I think this would be it if I hadn’t been clever enough to actually create a couple of widgets and place them on the layer that displays on my homepage.</p>
